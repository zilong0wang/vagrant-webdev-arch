# Introduction #

This Vagrantfile and related scripts are used to deploy an Arch Linux based web development environment.

# Quick start #

* To start your development environment, please follow these commands:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:zilong0wang/vagrant-webdev-arch.git 
$ cd vagrant-webdev-arch
$ vagrant up
```

* After that please add the following lines to your /etc/hosts file:
```
192.168.155.10      localhost.dev
192.168.155.10      pm.localhost.dev
```

* Default VirtualHost
  * localhost.dev (mapped to /vagrant/wwwroot)
  * pm.localhost.dev (mapped to /usr/share/webapps/phpMyAdmin) default user: root password: password

* Please note:
  * Keep your internet conection on and if you have a data limit please watch out. The base box will need around 400MB
      data and the provisoning process will need around 100MB.
  * The total deploy time with 1MB/s internet connection is 15~20 minutes, assuming you have reasonable hardware
      configuration.
